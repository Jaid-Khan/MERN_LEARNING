02 - Setting Up a Server with Express

Purpose:
This folder explains how to create a simple backend server using both the built-in Node.js HTTP module and the Express framework.
The goal is to understand the difference between a manual HTTP server and an Express-based server, and how Express makes routing easier and cleaner.

Concepts Learned:

Creating a Server with Node’s HTTP Module:

The http module is built into Node.js and allows you to create a web server manually.

You must handle routes (like "/", "/contact", "/about") using if-else conditions.

You must manually end the response using res.end().

Creating a Server with Express:

Express is built on top of the http module but provides a much simpler and cleaner syntax.

Instead of checking routes manually, you can use built-in routing methods such as app.get() and app.post().

Express also provides res.send() which automatically sets headers and ends the response.

Benefits of Using Express:

Easier route handling.

Automatically sets headers and ends responses.

More readable and scalable code.

Supports middleware and external packages easily.

Setup Steps:

Import Express
const express = require("express");

Create an app instance
const app = express();

Define a port number
const port = 3000;

Create routes
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
res.send("Home");
});

app.get("/contact", (req, res) => {
res.send("Contact");
});

app.get("/about", (req, res) => {
res.send("About");
});

Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
console.log(app listening on port ${port});
});

Run the server
Command: npm run dev
(Uses nodemon for auto-restart)

Code Summary:

// Using Node’s http module
const http = require("http");
const port = 3000;
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
if (req.url === "/") {
res.end("Home");
} else if (req.url === "/contact") {
res.end("Contact");
} else if (req.url === "/about") {
res.end("About");
} else {
res.end("404");
}
});
server.listen(port, () => {
console.log(Server listening on port ${port});
});

Code Summary (Using Express):

const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
res.send("Home");
});

app.get("/contact", (req, res) => {
res.send("Contact");
});

app.get("/about", (req, res) => {
res.send("About");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
console.log(app listening on port ${port});
});

Output:

Server starts successfully and logs:
“app listening on port 3000” in the terminal.

Visit in browser:
http://localhost:3000
 → shows “Home”
http://localhost:3000/contact
 → shows “Contact”
http://localhost:3000/about
 → shows “About”

Notes:

Express simplifies server creation and routing compared to Node’s http module.

You can also send HTML directly using res.send("<h1>Home</h1>").

This structure forms the foundation for building APIs and connecting a frontend (React) with a backend.

In the next steps, middleware and API routes will be added for dynamic data handling.
