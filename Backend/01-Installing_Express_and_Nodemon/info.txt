01 - Installing Express and Nodemon

Purpose:
This folder explains how to install and set up Express and Nodemon for a Node.js backend project.
The goal is to create a basic server, understand how Express simplifies routing, and use Nodemon for automatic restarts during development.

Concepts Learned:

Express:

Express is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Node.js.

It helps handle routes, requests, and responses easily.

It’s built on top of Node’s native http module but provides simpler syntax and extra features.

Nodemon:

Nodemon automatically restarts the server whenever file changes are detected.

It’s used only in development to save time (no need to manually restart the server).

HTTP vs Express:

Without Express, we create routes manually using if-else conditions.

With Express, we can easily use app.get(), app.post(), etc.

Setup Steps:

Initialize a new Node.js project
Command: npm init -y

Install Express
Command: npm install express

Install Nodemon (as a dev dependency)
Command: npm install nodemon --save-dev

Update package.json
In the “scripts” section, add:
"start": "node index.js",
"dev": "nodemon index.js"

Create index.js (main server file)
Sample code:

const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
res.send("Home Page");
});

app.get("/contact", (req, res) => {
res.send("Contact Page");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
console.log(Server running on port ${port});
});

Run the server
Command: npm run dev
(Nodemon will auto-restart when you save changes)

Files in This Folder:

index.js

Main file where the Express server is created.

Contains routes for "/" and "/contact".

package.json

Holds project details and scripts for running the app.

Includes dependencies for express and nodemon.

Output:

Running the server prints:
“Server running on port 3000” in the terminal.

Visiting in browser:
http://localhost:3000
 → shows “Home Page”
http://localhost:3000/contact
 → shows “Contact Page”

Notes:

Express simplifies handling HTTP requests compared to Node’s built-in http module.

Nodemon is for development only — not used in production.

Always check the terminal output for any port errors (e.g., port already in use).

This setup is the base for all future backend development (APIs, Middleware, MongoDB, etc.).
