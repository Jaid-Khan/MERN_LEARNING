Purpose:
This folder contains the initial setup of a React project using Vite for a fast development environment.
The goal is to understand how to install React properly, structure files, and run the project locally.

Steps Followed:

Create a React project using Vite
Command: npm create vite@latest my-react-app

Select framework
Choose: React
Variant: JavaScript (or TypeScript if preferred)

Go inside the project folder
Command: cd my-react-app

What is Vite and why it’s faster than Create React App (CRA)

Understanding React project folder structure

Role of key files:
• main.jsx → Entry point of the React app
• App.jsx → Root component
• index.html → HTML template

Using npm and npx commands

How the development server works

Files in This Folder:

main.jsx → renders the React app

App.jsx → root component

index.html → main HTML file

package.json → project dependencies and scripts

vite.config.js → Vite configuration file

Output:

Successfully created and ran a new React project with Vite.
The app runs on local server and displays the default Vite + React starter page.
