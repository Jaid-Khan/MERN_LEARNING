02 - Components and Props

Purpose:
This folder covers the concept of React Components and Props.
It explains how to create reusable components, pass data between them, and use props destructuring or children props.

Concepts Learned:

Components:

Functional Components are simple JavaScript functions that return JSX.

They help in breaking the UI into reusable, independent pieces.

Props (Properties):

Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

Props are read-only, meaning the child component cannot modify them.

Example: <Card name="Tony" age="20" gender="Male" />

Props Destructuring:

Instead of writing props.name, props.age, props.gender,
we can directly destructure props in the function parameters.

Example: function Card({ name, age, gender }) {}

Children Prop:

Anything written between <Card> ... </Card> is available as props.children.

Example: <Card>This is a Card.</Card>

Inside the component, it can be used as {children}.

Files in This Folder:

Card.jsx
Location: Frontend\02-Components_and_Props\src\components\Card.jsx
Description:

A functional component that receives props (name, age, gender).

Demonstrates props destructuring.

Includes a commented section showing how to use children props.

Code Summary:
function Card({ name, age, gender }) {
return (
<>
<div>{name}</div>
<div>{age}</div>
<div>{gender}</div>
</>
);
}

App.jsx
Location: Frontend\02-Components_and_Props\src\App.jsx
Description:

Parent component that imports and renders the Card component.

Demonstrates how to pass props and children to a component.

Code Summary:
<Card name="Tony" age="20" gender="Male" />
<Card name="Hulk" age="19" gender="Male" />
{/* Example of passing children: <Card>This Is a Card.</Card> */}

Commands Used:

npm run dev → to start the development server and view results in browser.

Output:

The app displays two cards showing:
Tony
20
Male
and
Hulk
19
Male

Props and destructuring concepts verified successfully.

Notes:

Props allow parent-to-child communication.

Destructuring keeps code short and readable.

Children prop is useful when you want to pass inner content dynamically.

This folder demonstrates the foundation for more complex React data flow (State, Context, etc.).
