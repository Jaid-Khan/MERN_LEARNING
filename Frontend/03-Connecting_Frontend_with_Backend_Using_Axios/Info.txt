📄 Frontend (03-Connecting_Frontend_With_Backend.txt)

Purpose:
This folder demonstrates how to connect the React frontend with the Node/Express backend using Axios for HTTP requests.
It helps verify communication between both parts of the MERN stack.

🧠 Concepts Learned:

Axios

A promise-based HTTP client used in React to send API requests to the backend.

Installed using:

npm install axios


Connecting to Backend

The React app (running on http://localhost:5173) makes a request to the backend server (running on http://localhost:3000).

Axios is used to call backend routes such as /, /api, etc.

Data Flow

React sends a request → Express server responds → Data logged or displayed in frontend.

⚙️ Setup Steps:

File: src/App.jsx

import './App.css';
import axios from "axios";

function App() {

  // Sending GET request to backend
  axios.get("http://localhost:3000/").then((res) => {
    console.log(res.data);
  });

  return (
    <>
      <h1>This is Frontend</h1>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;

✅ Result:

When the frontend runs, it sends a GET request to the backend.

The backend responds with a message (e.g., “Backend Working Fine!”).

The response is shown in the browser console.
